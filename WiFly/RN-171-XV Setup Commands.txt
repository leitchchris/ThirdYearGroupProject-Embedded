***************WiFi SETUP PHASE!!!!****************

Once connected over either local com port or wifi in ahoc mode

$$$		 - Enters command mode

factory R	 - factory reset to get the module to a known config (baud rate 9600)
reboot		 - to restart the module to make new settings active

$$$		 - Enters command mode after restart

scan 		 - Scan for wifi networks (just to make sure the network you want is in range/boradcasting)

(set up a persistent network)
set wlan ssid ThirdYearGroupProject     - sets ssid to connect to
set wlan pass ThirdYearGroupProject 	- sets network password/key
set ip address 192.168.0.65 		- sets wifly ip to given ip
set ip dhcp 0 	 			- turns DHCP off. The module uses its stored static IP address. 
set ip gateway 192.168.0.254 		- sets the gateway/router IP address
set ip netmask 255.255.255.0		- sets the netmask of the network 
set ip host 192.168.0.1			- sets the ip address the wifly will attempt to comminicate with
set ip remote 5000			- sets the remote computers port number (as per set ip host address)
set uart baud 57600			- sets the baud rate of the uart connection to 57600

The second lab is probably the most useful for speaking to / from wifly to server
